# The Custodians Archive - Twilight Imperium 4 Dashboard

A multiplayer dashboard application for Twilight Imperium 4 that enables seamless game state tracking across multiple devices with real-time synchronization.

## Overview

The Custodians Archive is inspired by Extra Computer but extends its functionality with multiplayer support, allowing players to join games from any device and interact with game state from their own screens. This eliminates the need for a single person to manage all updates and allows players to view detailed information without crowding around a central display.

## Key Features

- **Multiplayer Room System**: Create and join games using room codes
- **Flexible Authentication**: Support for both authenticated and guest users
- **Real-time Synchronization**: All players see updates instantly via Supabase
- **Player Agency**: Players can take their own actions when it's their turn
- **Multiple Views**: Switch between different information displays (objectives, faction sheets, tech trees, etc.)
- **Comprehensive Game Tracking**: Track all phases of TI4 from setup through victory
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop displays, tablets, and mobile devices

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18+ with Vite
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime + Auth)
- **Styling**: TBD (CSS Modules / Styled Components / Tailwind)
- **State Management**: TBD (Context API / Zustand / Redux)
- **Asset Management**: Vectorized SVG images for factions and game symbols

## Design Philosophy

- **Sci-fi aesthetic** with hard surface modeling inspiration
- **Minimalist approach** - clean and functional, not cluttered
- **Sharp edges and beveled corners** over rounded designs
- **Avoid gradients** - favor solid colors and clean lines
- **Paneling aesthetic** - compartmentalized UI elements
