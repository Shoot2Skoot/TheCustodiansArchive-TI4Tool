In the [[Prophecy of Kings]] expansion, each player has access to a new faction-specific ground force unit, the mech (mechanized unit).

Mechs are available from the start of the game; represented by an additional faction-specific unit card placed adjacent to the player board. This unit card is NOT a unit upgrade technology. It does not need to be researched and cannot be copied by the [[The Nekro Virus|Nekro Virus]].

Mechs function similarly to infantry in that they are able to take/hold planets and participate in [[Ground Combat]]. They all cost 2 to produce and almost always have a combat value of 6. Mechs also have the [[Sustain Damage]] ability as well as a faction-specific special ability.
