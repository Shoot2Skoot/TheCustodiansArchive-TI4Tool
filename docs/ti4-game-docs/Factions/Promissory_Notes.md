Promissory notes assist in negotiating with other players by creating an enforceable contract.

== Rules ==
Each player begins the game with five promissory note cards in their hand; four of which are generic; matching their player color, and one faction-specific card.

- [[Prophecy of Kings]] added an additional card called 'Alliance' bringing the default number to six. In addition, [[The Empyrean]] has two faction-specific Promissory notes instead of one, giving them 7 Total.

Players may trade promissory notes as part of a [[Transactions & Deals|transaction]] (one per transaction). Generally, when a player receives another player's promissory note, they place it in their hand and may use its ability as stated on the card

- Players may transact with any promissory notes in their hand (including those from other players)

- "Support for the Throne", "Alliance" and a number of faction-specific promissory notes are instead placed face up in the play area when received and thus may not be further exchanged

==General Promissory Notes==
General promissory notes are assigned by the color of components used, rather than by faction
