== Trivia ==

* The Barony of Letnev home system has the highest resource value of any system in the game (6)
** As of Thunder's Edge, this title is now shared with The Obsidian. However, you cannot start the game as the Obsidian, only the Firmament. This reduces the effectiveness of this home system, since it's not available during Round 1.
