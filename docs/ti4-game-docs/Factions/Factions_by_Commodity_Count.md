== Commodities ==
Commodities represent a sought after product produced by the player's faction. The maximum number of commodities each faction can have is represented by the number printed on their faction sheet. In the case of the example image, the number is 3, though this ranges from 2-4 depending on the faction played, excluding a single exception of 6.

Commodities are generally obtained from using the primary or secondary abilities of the [[Trade (Strategy card)|"Trade" strategy card]].[[File:Commodities.png|thumb]]A player is said to be "Refreshed" when their commodities are replenished to their maximum. The act of using the Trade strategy card's primary ability to chose a player to replenish commodities without spending a command counter is termed "Refreshing."

Commodities have no inherent value <u>but become trade goods when exchanged with other players.</u>

If a game effect instructs a player to convert a number of their own commodities to trade goods, those trade goods are not treated as being gained for the purpose of triggering other abilities.

A player cannot spend commodities unless otherwise specified.
