Leaders were reintroduced in the Expansion for Twilight Imperium Fourth Edition, [[Prophecy of Kings]].

== Types of Leaders ==
Each faction has access to 3 unique Leader cards\* (1 Agent, 1 Commander and 1 Hero), each representing an important named character for that faction.

\*'''Agents''': Identified by 1 Stripe in the Upper right corner of the front of the Card.
**Unlocked at the beginning of the game
**Have exhaustible abilities (thus usable once per round)
\*\*The majority of agents have abilities that may be used on any player (not just the player playing that faction)

\*'''Commanders''': Identified by 2 Stripes in the Upper right corner of the front of the Card.
**Unlocked via faction-specific unique requirements
**Have passive abilities that do not exhaust
**Their ability may be shared with another player through use of the [[Promissory Notes#Alliance|Alliance Promissory Note]]
**A commander’s unlock conditions cannot be met while an ability or game effect is being resolved. That is, pending abilities or partially resolved game effects must be completed before checking if conditions are met.
**A commander cannot flip to its locked side after it is unlocked, even if its owner no longer meets the unlock conditions.
**A commander cannot be exhausted.

\*'''Heroes''': Identified by 3 Stripes in the Upper right corner of the front of the Card
**Unlocked after scoring 3 objective cards (public or secret)
**Have powerful abilities that are used only once throughout the game (the Hero card is [[purge]]d after usage)
\*\*A hero cannot flip to its locked side after it is unlocked nor be exhausted.

(\*) [[The Nomad]] has 3 Agents, giving them 5 total leaders.

Each player has a leader sheet that contains slots for their faction’s three leader cards as well as their faction’s [[Mechs|mech]] unit card (as shown below).
