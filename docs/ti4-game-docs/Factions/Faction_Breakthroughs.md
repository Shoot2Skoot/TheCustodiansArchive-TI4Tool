[[File:Breakthrough Example.png|thumb|461x461px]]
Breakthroughs are a new faction-specific component introduced in the [[Thunder's Edge]] expansion. Each faction has a unique Breakthrough they can unlock during the game. 

A player can unlock their faction's Breakthrough in one of two ways:
* “Commit to the expedition” and lay claim to an unclaimed expedition slice on Thunder's Edge.
* Take control of Thunder's Edge after the planet has been placed on the game board.

Each Breakthrough has two effects: a unique ability, and a "synergy" between two technology colors.

A synergy is a simple yet potent effect. On each faction's Breakthrough are two technology symbols. Whenever you are researching technology or scoring technology-related objectives, you can treat the technology colors of your existing technologies that match those on your Breakthrough as either of the two for the purpose of fulfilling requirements (but not both).

For example: The Embers of Muaat start with the (Warfare) Plasma Scoring technology and their Breakthrough Synergy is between Warfare & Cybernetic. Assuming they have no other technology yet in the game and have unlocked their Breakthrough, they could research Graviton Laser System (a Level 1 Cybernetic technology), but not PDS II (a Level 2 Warfare & Cybernetic technology).
