Starting units are the ships, ground forces and structures that each player starts the game with in their [[Planets and Systems#Home Systems|Home System]].

This page lists each faction's starting fleet as listed on the back of their respective faction sheet.  

The value of each faction's fleet is listed below for comparison. The number is calculated by adding up the resource total of all ships and ground forces and assuming the cost of each PDS and Space Dock to be the equivalent of 3 resources each (1 [[Command Tokens|Command Token]] for [[Construction (Strategy card)|Construction Secondary]]). 

Each faction starts the game with 1 space dock (not listed but included in the calculation) and at least 2 infantry.<br />
