===Pax Magnifica===
Details a new scenario, "Ordinian," featuring 6 preset factions fighting for control of a disabled Argent Flight flagship (which starts in the Nekro Virus' possession). 


===The Nexus===
Features a 6 player galaxy preset, "Right Cat Soup," by Christopher Chick.


===Rules Updates===
*'''[[Diplomacy (Strategy card)|Diplomacy strategy card]]:''' The Primary ability has been updated to allow the resolving player to refresh any two of their planets, rather than each planet in the chosen system.
*'''[[Biotic Technologies#Hyper Metabolism|Hypermetabolism]]''': The printing error has been corrected. The card now reads: During the status phase, gain 3 command tokens instead of 2.
*'''[[Planets and Systems#Anomalies|Gravity Rifts]]:''' To avoid a number of unusual mechanical interactions, the timing and exact effect of gravity rifts has been adjusted. Now, units will roll for the gravity rift as they pass through it rather than in the destination system, and units that fail to survive the roll are removed from the board and returned to players’ reinforcements rather than being destroyed—meaning that abilities that trigger when a unit is destroyed are not resolved.
*'''Retreating with Infantry:''' Retreating from a combat while transporting [[Ground Forces|ground forces]] that are on [[Planets and Systems|planets]] in the active system—previously a cumbersome and often confusing process—has been streamlined. Players no longer need to move ground forces from a planet to the space area during the “[[Space Combat|Announce Retreats]]” step. Instead, when a [[Units#Ships|ship]] moves as part of a retreat, it can transport ground forces that are on planets in its system as normal.
*'''Re-rolls during combat:''' Abilities that re-roll or modify dice during combat no longer need to be used immediately following a single die roll. Instead, a player can roll dice for all of their units in the combat before deciding which—if any—to re-roll.

It can be downloaded [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/f6/be/f6be8343-a4fc-47e4-a722-efe3e01fc5d9/ti_codex_4_rules.pdf here], with additional print outs for new components found [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/cb/66/cb665e94-442d-4bd0-b5bc-6553f64321fc/ti_codex_4_cards.pdf here].

===Ixthian Artifacts===
The Ixthian Artifact section includes 3 new [[Exploration#Relic Fragments and Relics|relics]] (bringing the total up to 16) and introduces a new component, Galactic Events, which alter the rules of the game from the start.

==== Galactic Events ====
Introduced for the first time in Codex IV is a new type of component: [[Galactic Events]].  Galactic Events	change the fundamental	rules of the game by warping the expected way that things work, or by adding entirely new game systems.

Galactic Events are picked during setup and are entirely optional. One event can be selected randomly from the deck, or one can be selected ahead of time—advanced players can even try playing with multiple Galactic Events at once. Below are the four Galactic Events released in Codex IV.
{| class="article-table"
!
!Complexity
!Effect
|-
|'''Minor Factions'''
|2
|During setup, players are dealt 1 fewer blue tile. Before creating the galaxy, shuffle the reference cards for factions not being played and deal 1 to each player. In speaker order, each player places that faction's home system in the second ring, equidistant from players' home systems. Then, that player places 3 neutral infantry on that system's planets, split as evenly as possible. These systems are minor faction systems and do not count as home systems.

When a player controls each planet in a minor faction system, they take that factions alliance card from the deck or from the player that owned it previously.

Planets in minor faction systems gain all three planet traits (cultural, industrial, and hazardous).
|-
|'''Total War'''
|3
|When a player destroys or produces a hit that destroys another player's units, they place commodities from the supply equal to the combined cost of the units they destroyed on a planet they control in their home system (infantry and fighters are worth 1 each).

When a player gains control of a home system that has commodities, they move those commodities to a planet they control in their own home system.

All players can perform the following action:

ACTION: Discard 10 commodities from planets in your home system to gain 1 victory point.
|-
|'''Age of Commerce'''
|1
|Players do not have to be neighbors to perform transactions with each other.

Players do not have a maximum number of commodities; when they refresh commodities, they gain a number of commodities equal to their commodities value instead.

Players can share non-faction technology with other players as part of a transaction. When sharing technology, the receiving player gains that technology from their own deck; the sharing player does not lose the technology.
|-
|'''Age of Exploration'''
|2
|Relics only require 2 matching fragments be purged instead of 3.

The Naaz-Rokha Alliance's '''''Fabrication''''' faction ability and '''''Black Market Forgery''''' promissory note do not require purged fragments to match.

All players can perform the following action:

ACTION: Exhaust '''''Dark Energy Tap''''' and choose a non-home edge system that contains your ships to roll a 1 die. On a result of 1 - 4, draw a random unused red tile; on a result of 5 - 10, draw an random unused blue tile. Place that tile adjacent to the chosen system so that it is touching 2 non-home systems. Place a frontier token in the system if it does not contain any planets.
|}

===Pax Magnifica===
Details a new scenario, "Liberation of Ordinian," featuring 6 preset factions fighting for control over the Nekro-controlled world of Ordinian (which starts in the Nekro Virus' possession).

=== The Mecatol Report ===
A section is written and designed for the '''Genesys Roleplaying Game''', specifically to complement the '''Embers of the Imperium''' sourcebook which allows for a Twilight Imperium RPG. This section contains information about Keleres Headquarters on Mecatol Rex as well as some additional creatures to fight, and a short adventure for GMs to implement.

===Voice of One===
An excerpt from the Twilight Imperium Novel by Tristan Palmgren 'Voice of One' was featured.

=== Omega Initiative ===
In an Fantasy Flight Live Stream on YouTube the day after Codex IV was released, designer Dane Beltrami revealed that two basic technologies that have already been changed once (Magen Defense Grid and X-89 Bacterial Weapon) would be getting revised yet again. A PDF file of these newest version of these technologies called "Codex 4.5" can be found [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/e9/8f/e98f4722-2f45-4328-9119-56508bf1c94b/codex_45_technology_card_updates.pdf here].

====<u>Basic Technologies</u>====
