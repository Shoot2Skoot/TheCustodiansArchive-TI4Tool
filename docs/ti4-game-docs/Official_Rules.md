== Pattern of Play ==
A game of Twilight Imperium takes place over a number of rounds.

=== Game Phases ===
Each round is made up of 4 game phases. The agenda phase is skipped if the custodian token has not been removed from Mecatol Rex.

==== [[Strategy Phase]] ====
Players select their strategy cards and unchosen strategy cards have trade goods placed on them.

Some faction/component abilities may trigger during the strategy phase.

==== [[Action Phase]] ====
Player's turns take place during the action phase. The action phase continues until all players have passed.

==== [[Status Phase]] ====
During the status phase, players perform various upkeep tasks. The steps of the status phase are done in the following order:

# Score Objectives
# Reveal Public Objective
# Draw Action Cards
# Remove Command Tokens
# Gain and Redistribute Command Tokens
# Ready Cards
# Repair Units
# Return Strategy Cards

==== [[Agenda Phase]] ====
During this phase players use the influence from the planets they control to vote on agendas. At the end of the phase all planets that were used for voting are readied.

=== Player Turns ===
[[File:Ti07 strategy 5 trade.png|thumb|167x167px]]
During a player's turn they may perform one of three types of actions, or they may choose to pass.

==== Strategic Action ====

# The active player performs the primary action of their strategy card.
# The nonactive players may choose to perform the secondary action of that strategy card, if they are able.
# The active player exhausts their strategy card.

==== Component Action ====
[[File:Action card example.PNG|thumb|193x193px]]
# The active player performs the action listed on a component that contains the text "ACTION:"

==== Tactical Action ====
The active player performs the following steps in order:

# [[File:Movementexample.png|thumb|179x179px]][[Activation]]
# [[Movement]]
# [[Space Combat]]
# [[Invasion]]
# [[Production]]
Note: Players may activate a system and still choose not to move any units during the movement step.

== Ending the Game ==
The game can end in one of three ways:

=== 10 Victory Points ===
The game ends immediately when one player has 10 victory points. If multiple players would simultaneously gain their 10th victory point, the player who is earliest in initiative order among those players is the winner; if this occurs when players do not have strategy cards, the player who is nearest the speaker (including the speaker) in clockwise order is the winner.

=== All Objectives Revealed ===
If the game ends because the speaker cannot reveal an objective card, the player with the most victory points is the winner. If one or more players are tied for having the most victory points, the tied player who is first in initiative order is the winner.

=== Players Agree to End the Game ===
If all remaining players agree to end the game, then the game ends and there is no winner.
