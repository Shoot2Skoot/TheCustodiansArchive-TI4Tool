== Choosing a Strategy Card ==
During the [[Strategy Phase|strategy phase]], players take turns selecting a strategy card. The first player to pick is the [[Speaker]], followed by the player to their left, and so on until each player has chosen a strategy card.

=== Three and Four Player Games ===
In a three or four player game, after the last player has chosen their first strategy card, each player selects a second strategy card, starting again with the speaker and proceeding clockwise.

=== Trade Goods ===
After players are done picking their strategy cards, each unpicked strategy card then has one trade good from the supply placed on it by the Speaker. A player who picks that strategy card in a future round will add those trade goods to their supply.

=== Game Effects that Affect Strategy Card Selection ===
The game effects listed below can interrupt strategy card selection:

|}

==== Promissory Notes ====
In the Fourth Edition base game The Winnu's [[Promissory Notes|promissory note]], Acquiescence, could affect strategy card choice. The [[Prophecy of Kings]] expansion included a new version of the Acquiescence promissory note that no longer granted this ability.

|-
|[[The Winnu]]

|-
|Checks and Balances {{Edition|Prophecy of Kings}}
|FOR : When a player chooses a strategy card during the strategy phase, they give that strategy card to another player that does not have 1 (or a player that does not have 2 in a three- or four-player game), if able.
AGAINST : Each player readies only 3 of their planets at the end of this agenda phase.
|}

== Playing a Strategy Card ==
The playing of a strategy card is considered a "strategic action." 

When a player performs a strategic action, they resolve the primary ability of their [[Strategy Cards|strategy card]]. After resolving this ability, each other player in clockwise order may resolve the secondary ability of that strategy card. The active player '''cannot''' resolve the secondary ability of their own strategy card. 

After a player performs a strategic action, they exhaust the strategy card that corresponds to that action (by turning it upside down). A player cannot pass until they have performed a strategic action. 

=== Game Effects that Affect Strategic Actions ===
The game effects listed below can affect strategic actions:

==== Action Cards ====
{| class="fandom-table"
!'''Name'''
!'''Text'''
|-
|Coup d'Etat {{Edition|Prophecy of Kings}}
|When another player would perform a strategic action:
End that player's turn; the strategic action is not resolved and the strategy card is not exhausted.
|}

==== Promissory Notes ====

|-
|[[The Winnu]]
|Acquiescence Ω <big>{{Edition|Codex I}}</big>
|When the Winnu player resolves a strategic action:
You do not have to spend or place a command token to resolve the secondary ability of that strategy card.

Then, return this card to the Winnu player
|}

|-
|Galactic Crisis Pact

|}

== Returning a Strategy Card ==
As the final action of the status phase each player returns their strategy card to the common play area.

=== Game Effects that Affect the Return of Strategy Cards ===

==== Action Cards ====

!'''Text'''
|-
|Political Stability
|When you would return your strategy card(s) during the status phase:
Do not return your strategy card(s). You do not choose strategy cards during the next strategy phase.
|}

=== Elimination ===
A player who is eliminated immediately returns any strategy cards they hold to the common play area.

== [[Initiative Order]] ==
Initiative order is the order in which players resolve steps of the [[Action Phase|action]] and [[Status Phase|status]] phases. This determines who takes the first action during the action phase, and who scores first during the status phase. 

Initiative order is determined by the initiative numbers on [[Strategy Cards|strategy cards]]. Initiative order begins with the player who has the lowest-numbered strategy card and proceeds to the player who has the strategy card that is next in numerical order. Strategy cards not chosen during the strategy phase are ignored. 

=== Game Effects that Affect Initiative Order ===

== Trivia ==
* A player can only resolve the '''primary''' ability of their '''own''' strategy cards.
* A player can only resolve the '''secondary''' ability of strategy cards that were chosen by '''other''' players.
* A player may still resolve the '''secondary''' ability of strategy cards even if they are passed.
