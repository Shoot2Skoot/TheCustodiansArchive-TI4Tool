See: [[Agenda Phase]]

Agenda cards represent galactic laws and policies. Each agenda card has text that includes a number of possible outcomes that will affect the game. During each agenda phase, players will vote for which outcome they want to occur.

There are two types of agenda cards: '''Laws''' and '''Directives'''

There are a total of 50 Agenda Cards (34 Laws and 16 Directives) 

== Laws ==
Laws can permanently change the rules of the game. If enacted, players resolve the outcome and place the agenda card either in the common play area or in a player’s play area, as dictated by the card.

==[[FAQ]]==
'''Q: '''When a “Research Team” agenda that is attached to a [[Planets and Systems|planet]] is used to ignore a prerequisite, is the planet [[Readied and Exhausted|exhausted]]?

'''A:''' No. The <u>agenda</u> is exhausted to ignore the prerequisite, not the planet.


'''Q''': If the “Classified Document Leaks” agenda is discarded, what happens?

'''A''': The [[Objectives#Secret Objectives|secret objective]] remains in play (i.e. players who scored it do not lose the point) but it is no longer a public objective and thus cannot by scored by any additional players. Additionally, it does not count toward the secret objective total of the player who originally owned it


'''Q:''' Does the “Enforced Travel Ban” agenda prevent “[[Space Cannon]]” usage through [[Planets and Systems#Wormholes|wormholes]]?

'''A:''' No. “Enforce Travel Ban” does not prevent “Space Cannon” usage.


'''Q''': During a revote initiated by the “Miscount Disclosed” agenda, does the law that is being voted on remain active and in play?

'''A:''' Yes, the law that is being voted on because of “Miscount Disclosed” remains in play during the revote.


'''Q:''' If there is an ‘A’ [[Planets and Systems#Wormholes|wormhole]] on [[Planets and Systems#Mecatol Rex|Mecatol Rex]] when the “Ixthian Artifact” agenda causes units in adjacent systems to be destroyed, does the "[[Faction Abilities#The Ghosts of Creuss|Quantum Entanglement]]" ability cause the Ghost of Creuss faction to lose units in a system that contains a ‘B’ wormhole?

'''A''': No. Only the Creuss treats those systems as adjacent.


'''Q:''' When units are destroyed by the “Ixthian Artifact” agenda, in what order are they destroyed?

'''A''': Units destroyed by “Ixthian Artifact” are destroyed simultaneously


'''Q''': Can the “Colonial Redistribution” agenda elect a [[Planets and Systems|planet]] that is already the target of “Demilitarized Zone,” and if so, can the chosen player place [[infantry]] to take control of the planet?

'''A''': Both agendas may target the same planet. However, in that situation, infantry cannot be placed on the elected planet, so it remains under the control of its original owner.


'''Q:''' When the “Holy Planet of Ixth,” “Shard of the Throne,” or “The Crown of Emphidia” agendas are repealed, does the player who owns them lose a victory point?

'''A:''' No, the player who gained a victory point from these agendas can only lose that point through the effect stated on the card. If the card is discarded in any other way, such as the “Repeal Law” action card, the point is not lost.


'''Q''': Is the trigger for the “Minister of War” agenda card’<nowiki/>s ability “performing an action”?

'''A:''' Yes. Performing any action is the trigger for the remainder of the “Minister of War” agenda card’s ability.


'''Q:''' How does the Agenda "Publicize Weapon Schematics" affect the Embers of Muaat's [[The Embers of Muaat#Faction Unit Upgrades|War Suns]]?

'''A:''' Prototype War Sun I is considered a [[War Sun|war sun]] but is a printed unit <u>not</u> a war sun technology. Thus, a vote of "For" would mean that it would lose the [[Sustain Damage]] ability but other players would not be able to ignore war sun prerequisites. A vote of "Against" would not affect the Muaat player. The agenda plays as normal if the Muaat player has researched Prototype War Sun II.


'''Q:''' If the agenda "Shared Research" passes  as <u>against</u>, does a player place a [[Command Tokens|Command Token]] in their [[Planets and Systems#Home Systems|home system]] if they do not control planets in their home system?

'''A:''' A home system is always that player's home system meaning they still do place a command counter in that system even though they do not control it
