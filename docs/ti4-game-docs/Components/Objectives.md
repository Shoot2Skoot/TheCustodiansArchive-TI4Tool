'''Type: '''[[Player Components]]

A game of Twilight Imperium Fourth Edition ends immediately after a player scores the required number of victory points to win (10 by default). The main way to score victory points is to complete objectives, of which there are two types: [[Objectives#Public Objectives|'''Public Objectives''']] and [[Objectives#Secret Objectives|'''Secret Objectives''']].  Each objective card describes the requirement a player must fulfill to score the objective and the [[Official Rules#Game Phases|phase]] in which it may be scored.

For a breakdown of objectives visit [[Analysis of Objectives]].
== Public Objectives ==
Public Objectives are divided into Stage I and Stage II. Stage I Objectives are worth 1 Victory Point and Stage II Objectives are worth 2 Victory Points. 

Outside of use of the [[Imperial (Strategy card)|Imperial Strategy Card]], Public Objectives are scored in the Scoring step of the [[Status Phase]]. Each player may score a maximum of one Public Objective each Status Phase. "Spend" objectives refer to spending the specified amount during the Status Phase, not to spending that occurred during the [[Action Phase]] to purchase units, technologies, etc.

A player cannot score public objectives if that player does not control each planet in their [[Home System|home system]].<br />

== Secret Objectives ==
Secret Objectives are unique objectives worth 1 Victory Point. During game setup, each player is dealt two Secret Objectives face down. They must pick one to keep, while the other is returned face down to the secret objective deck, which is subsequently reshuffled. Each Secret Objective may only be scored by a player that has it in their hand. 

Players gain additional Secret Objectives primarily through use of the [[Imperial (Strategy card)|Imperial Strategy Card]]. The maximum number of Secret Objectives (scored or unscored) a player may have in their play area is 3. If a player already has 3 total Secret Objectives and draws an extra, they must return one unscored objective face down to the Secret Objective deck, which is subsequently reshuffled.  

A Secret Objective may be scored during either the Action Phase, Status Phase or Agenda Phase depending on the card's specified timing window. 

Unlike Public Objectives, a player is not required to control all planets in their home system to score Secret Objectives. 



=== Action Phase ===
Any number of Action Phase Secret Objectives may be scored during an [[Action Phase]]; however, each must be in a separate [[combat]]. A [[Space Combat]] and a subsequent [[Ground Combat]] in the same [[Tactical Action|tactical action]] are considered separate combats. 

If a player is scoring an Action Phase Secret Objective, they must do so immediately after fulfilling its requirements. It may not be scored at any other time during the Action Phase.

== [[FAQ]] ==
'''Q''': Can the “Turn Their Fleets to Dust” [[Objectives#Secret Objectives|objective]] be fulfilled by using a “Direct Hit” [[Action Cards|action card]] or by destroying a unit with capacity and allowing transported [[fighter]]s to be removed as a result?

'''A''': In the original version of the objective, the Space Cannon ability does not destroy the last ship in either scenario, so the objective is not fulfilled. In the Omega version, the ships are destroyed during the Space Cannon Offense step, so the objective is fulfilled.
