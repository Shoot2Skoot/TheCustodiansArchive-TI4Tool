As players move about the galaxy and expand their empire beyond their home systems, they will gain control of new planets. [[Ground Forces|Ground forces]] and [[Units#Structures|structures]] are usually placed on planets.

__TOC__

== Planet Cards ==
[[File:Resources_vs_influence.jpg|thumb]]
When a player gains control of a planet, they take that planet’s card and place it facedown in their play area. The planet card is taken from either the deck of planet cards or from the player who controlled it previously. Each planet card displays two values: resources on the left in yellow and influence on the right in blue. Players spend resources to acquire new units and technologies. Players spend influence to gain command tokens and to vote during the agenda phase.

If a player ever controls a planet but has no units on that planet, that player places one of the control tokens that matches their faction on that planet to mark that they control it.

== Characteristics ==
This table lays out the possible characteristics that planets may have. Following sections will contain more detail on each Symbol.

== Planet Traits ==
[[File:Planettypes.png|right]]
Planets outside of home systems have a planet trait. There are three types of planet traits: Cultural, Hazardous, and Industrial. Planet Traits are mainly used to for scoring specific [[objectives]] (e.g. "Control 4 Cultural planets"), but also provide thematic flavor to the planet's characteristics. Hazardous planets typically have more resources and less influence, while Cultural planets typically have more influence and fewer resources.

In the [[Prophecy of Kings]] expansion, a planet's trait corresponds to the [[Exploration#List of Exploration and Frontier Cards|exploration deck]] a player draws from after [[Exploration|exploring]] the planet.

In the [[Thunder's Edge]] expansion, some planets have two traits. These planets count as having both traits for the purpose of scoring objectives. When exploring a dual-trait planet, the player may pick which exploration deck they draw a card from (but not both).

== Technology Specialty ==
[[File:TechSpecExample.png|right|250x250px]]
Some planets have a [[technology]] specialty, marked by the symbol for either green, blue, yellow or red technology. A player that has control of one or more of these planets may exhaust them to satisfy a prerequisite of that color when [[Technology#Research|researching]] technology (i.e. they can be used as 'technology skips'). A player must choose whether to exhaust the planet for technology OR for its resources/influence.

Some planets have dual specialties, marked by two technology symbols. When exhausting these planets to satisfy prerequisites, they may satisfy either or both prerequisites simultaneously.

== Mecatol Rex ==
''(Note: If playing with the Thunder's Edge expansion, Mecatol Rex has been changed to a legendary planet and is listed in the [[Legendary Planets]] page)''
[[File:Mecatol.png|thumb|Mecatol Rex Tile]]
[[File:UpdatedMecatolTile.png|thumb|Updated Mecatol Rex Tile (Thunder's Edge Expansion)]]
<blockquote>''"Of all the planets in the galaxy, no planet was more war-torn than Mecatol Rex. Over the course of only a few years, the planet’s ecology was ravaged by bombardments, its population nearly wiped out, and its green fields blasted into a toxic wasteland."''</blockquote>Mecatol Rex is the planet placed in the center of the game board during setup.

During setup, the Custodians Token is placed on Mecatol Rex. This token prevents a player from committing ground forces to land on the planet unless they spend six influence to remove the token.

Once a player does remove the Custodians Token, they place it in their play area and gain one victory point. Since the galactic council can now convene on Mecatol Rex, the [[Agenda Phase|agenda phase]] is added as the last phase of each game round.

== [[Legendary Planets]] ==
Legendary planets are special planets, introduced in the [[Prophecy of Kings]] expansion, that have significance within the Twilight Imperium game. They each have an associated ability listed on a special Legendary Planet Ability card.

Legendary planets are indicated by the following symbol: [[File:Legendary_Symbol.png|25x25px]]

== [[Home System|Home Systems]] ==
Each player begins the game with their [[Starting Units|units]] on a system tile with planet(s) unique to their chosen faction, known as their home system. Home system tiles are differentiated with green-colored backs, and their corresponding faction's symbol in one corner.

See: [[Home System#Base Game|Home System]] for a detailed list of all factions' home systems.

==== [[The Fracture]] ====
The Fracture is a special area of the play board, that can can come into play due to several effects. Planets in the Fracture are unique in that they are guarded by Neutral Units that must be defeated before a planet can be claimed. However, the first time each planet becomes controlled by a player, that player gains a [[Exploration#Relics|Relic]].
