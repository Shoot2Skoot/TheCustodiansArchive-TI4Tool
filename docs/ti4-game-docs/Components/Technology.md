'''Category:''' [[Official Rules#Additional Rules|Rules]][[File:Tech Base Game.PNG|thumb|Refence for Base Game tech.]]Players obtain technology in the form of technology cards.[[File:Tech Pok.PNG|thumb|Refence for POK tech.]]Technologies provide players with powerful [[abilities]] and allow players to upgrade their [[units]]. Each player has an identical deck of basic technology cards that they may look through at any time, as well as 2 [[Faction Technologies|faction specific]] technology cards (which may or may not be [[Unit Upgrades|unit upgrade technology]]).[[File:Tech Pok Codex.PNG|thumb|Refence for POK and Codex IV tech.]]

== Technology Types ==

=== Basic Technologies ===
There are four basic colors of technology. A technology’s color is indicated by a green, red, blue, or yellow symbol located on the lower-right corner of the card. Players use these symbols when researching technology.

See [[Starting Technology]] for a list of basic technology that each faction starts the game with. 
=== [[Faction Technologies]] ===
Faction technologies are special technologies unique to specific [[factions]]. Like regular technologies, they are each one of the four types and have a certain number of prerequisites. Faction-specific Unit Upgrades are also faction technologies but are included in the both the "[[Unit Upgrades]]" and [[Faction Specific Units|"Faction Specific Units"]]  section. 

===[[Unit Upgrades|Unit Upgrade Technologies]]===
Unit Upgrade Technologies allow players to research technologies that directly improve their units. These technologies often have multiple color prerequisites. <br />

== Obtaining Technology ==

=== Research ===
The predominant way of gaining technology is by researching technology. Players may research technology through use of the Primary or Secondary Abilities of the [[Technology (Strategy card)|“Technology” strategy card]], certain [[Action Cards]], or [[abilities]]. Any time a player researches a technology, they must satisfy the prerequisites. 

Once a player researches technology (i.e. pays the cost and satisfies the prerequisites), they gain that technology and place it face up in their play area. The technology card is received [[Readied and Exhausted|unexhausted]] and may be played at any time after it is gained. 

=== Prerequisites ===
Prerequisites are printed as a column on the lower-left side of each technology card and contain one or more symbols that correspond to the four technology types. Some technologies have no prerequisites and can be researched without owning any technology.

To satisfy a technology’s prerequisites, a player must own a matching technology for each prerequisite symbol on the card they wish to research. (For example researching [[Propulsion Technologies#Light/Wave Deflector|"Light/Wave Deflector]]" requires that a player own 3 blue technologies prior to being able to be researched.) Unit upgrade technologies do <u>not</u> satisfy prerequisites when researching technology.

===Technology Specialty Planets===
If a player controls a [[Planets and Systems#Planets|planet]] that has a technology specialty symbol, they may [[Readied and Exhausted|exhaust]] that planet when researching technology to ignore a prerequisite that matches that technology specialty. Players may exhaust planets for their technology specialty or for their [[Spending Resources and Influence|resources/influence]], but not for both.

===Gain===
Certain effects and [[abilities]] may instruct a player to Gain technology. In such circumstances, technology can be obtained without considering prerequisites.

It is worth noting that players gain a technology they have researched after they research it.


==Technology Reference==
The following section contains all the technologies in the game in table format for easy reference.  

Level 0/1/2/3/4 corresponds to the number of Prerequisite technologies required before the technology in question is able to be researched.
